## Instructions for Logic Exercise

Exercise solved using both functional composition and OOP paradigms.
Files for functional solution are under /logic_exercise/composition and
files for OOP solution are under /logic_exercise/inheritance.

### Functional solution

To run code in local dev environment, run `npm run watchCompositionLogic` and go to `http://localhost:8080` if not directed there automatically and see the result in the console.

To create production build, run `npm run buildCompositionLogic`. This creates a distLogic directory with the final JS bundle / index.html files.

### OOP solution

To run code in local dev environment, run `npm run watchInheritanceLogic` and go to `http://localhost:8080` if not directed there automatically and see the result in the console.

To create production build, run `npm run buildInheritanceLogic`. This creates a distLogic directory with the final JS bundle / index.html files.

## Instructions for UI Exercise
